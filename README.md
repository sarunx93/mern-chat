# MERN Chat App

This is my practice project. It is a full-stack MERN chat-app.
I have always been curious about how a chat-app works, so I learned this from online and planned to add more features in the future.

## How to run the project
After cloning this repo, please run `npm install` at the root and insdie frontend folder. Then, run `npm run server` at the root and `npm run dev` inside frontend folder.
